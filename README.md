# Website-about-me
This is my own website I created purely for show-off my skills. I am fully aware this is a very basic website however so are my skills. I am still learning it on my own time and efforts so please consider it. I am undertaking a udemy course i paid for and the progress is slow but steady.
This is the udemy course I am doing right now: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/?couponCode=KEEPLEARNING
I am also just about to finish (I mean i am awaiting for certification of completion) a level 3 Software Development course in Warrington and Vale Royal College. In this I have learned the followings:
- Programming Implementation (Python)
- Project Management
- Object Oriantated Programming in Python (Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism)
- Software Testing (Balck box - , white box -, automated testing)
- Programming with JavaScript (HTML, CSS, Javascript)
- Maths for Computing (Matrices, Vectors, Number Systems)
- Robot Technology

I am still very new to this industry as I am coming from pharmaceutical industry and I have no experience beforehand with IT. I hope it will be enough for you to consider me for an internship or a job role. Every opportunity is a great for me and I am very grateful in advance!
